        <p>Food is the substance we eat every day for energy and strength. There are many different types of food, such as fruits, vegetables, rice, and pasta. We need to eat a variety of foods to get all the essential nutrients the body needs. Not eating a healthy and balanced diet leads to weakness and deficiency diseases</p>
        <p>Food is divided into categories such as grains, proteins, fruits, vegetables, and dairy.

                <p>Fooding is a brand of a restaurant guide and gastronomic events that was founded in 2000. A
                    contraction of the words "food" and "feeling", the Fooding aims to "defend a less-intimidating
                    gastronomy for those who want to cook and nourish themselves in an unstuffy fashion". 
                    The food essays are meant to set an example for essay writing. Your child can learn facts about foods as well as structure such essays. Using the above essays as an example, they can easily write their own.</p>

                <h2 class="h-secondary-center">Food Ordering</h2><br>
                <p>Online food ordering is a process of ordering food from a local restaurant or food cooperative
                    through a web page or app. Much like ordering consumer goods online, many of these allow customers
                    to keep accounts with them in order to make frequent ordering convenient. A customer will search for
                    a favorite restaurant, usually filtered via type of cuisine and choose from available items, and
                    choose delivery or pick-up. Payment can be amongst others either by credit card or cash, with the
                    restaurant returning a percentage to the online food company.

                <h2 class="h-secondary-center">Quick Fast Delivery</h2><br>
                <p>Online food ordering is the process of ordering food, for delivery or pickup, from a website or other
                    application. The product can be either ready-to-eat food (e.g., direct from a home-kitchen,
                    restaurant, or a virtual restaurant) or food that has not been specially prepared for direct
                    consumption (e.g., vegetables direct from a farm/garden, fruits, frozen meats. etc).
                    Fast food is a type of mass-produced food designed for commercial resale, with a strong priority
                    placed on speed of service. It is a commercial term, limited to food sold in a restaurant or store
                    with frozen, preheated or precooked ingredients and served in packaging for take-out/take-away.</p>

                <h2 class="h-secondary-center">Catering</h2><br>
                <p>More and more people are turning to the services of professional caterers for weddings, private
                    dinner parties and corporate events for good reason. It takes a lot of preparation and planning to
                    run successful event or party. With the help of a professional catering service, you can relax,
                    enjoy the event and spend time with your guests.

                    Caterers generally provide food but are increasingly providing a wider array of event planning
                    services such as decorations, equipment hire (tableware, linen, tables and chairs), staffing and
                    event coordination. A caterer will work with you to develop an innovative menu to match your event
                    or celebration's theme, your food tastes, and importantly, your budget. </p>

In the north, people prefer wheat, which they make in to bread and noodles. Corn millet, and sorghum are also eaten. Vegetables, especially cabbage and Tofu rank second in Chinese diet. Roasted sweet potatoes are a popular snack eaten by the Chinese. Pork and poultry are the favorite meats in China. The people also like eggs, fish, fruit, and shellfish.
